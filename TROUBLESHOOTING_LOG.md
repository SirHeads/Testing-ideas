# Workspace Indexer Troubleshooting Log

This document details the step-by-step process of diagnosing and resolving the issues encountered while running the `workspace_indexer/indexer.py` script.

## 1. Initial Execution Failures

*   **Issue:** The script was initially run directly (`workspace_indexer/indexer.py`), which resulted in a `zsh: permission denied` error, followed by `import: command not found` after making it executable.
*   **Analysis:** The shell was trying to execute the Python script as a shell script.
*   **Solution:** The script was correctly executed using the Python 3 interpreter: `python3 workspace_indexer/indexer.py`.

## 2. Missing Python Dependencies

*   **Issue:** The script failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'`.
*   **Analysis:** The required Python packages were not installed in the user's environment.
*   **Solution:** Installed all necessary packages using pip: `pip3 install python-dotenv qdrant-client langchain-community langchain-openai unstructured pypdf python-pptx python-docx tiktoken`.

## 3. Missing Environment Variables

*   **Issue:** The script failed with `ERROR - One or more environment variables are not set`.
*   **Analysis:** The script required connection URLs and names for the Qdrant and embedding services, which are loaded from a `.env` file. This file was missing.
*   **Solution:** Created a `.env` file in the workspace root with the required variables: `QDRANT_URL`, `EMBEDDING_SERVICE_URL`, and `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME`.

## 4. Incorrect Script Logic and Configuration

*   **Issue:** The script was still failing to load environment variables and had some brittle configurations.
*   **Analysis:** The script was looking for `EMBEDDING_API_URL` instead of `EMBEDDING_SERVICE_URL`, and it required a workspace path argument.
*   **Solution:** Modified `indexer.py` to:
    1.  Correctly reference `EMBEDDING_SERVICE_URL`.
    2.  Make the API key and model name optional for local services.
    3.  Default the `workspace_path` to the current directory (`.`) to simplify execution.

## 5. Incorrect Qdrant Connection

*   **Issue:** The script failed with `TypeError: from_existing_collection() missing 1 required positional argument: 'path'`.
*   **Analysis:** The script was using a deprecated method to connect to the Qdrant server.
*   **Solution:** Updated `indexer.py` to use the modern `qdrant_client` for establishing a connection before initializing the `Qdrant` vector store object.

## 6. Failure to Ignore Virtual Environment

*   **Issue:** The script was incorrectly processing files inside the `.venv` directory.
*   **Analysis:** The `.rooignore` file was created, but the script's parsing logic was not correctly handling the directory pattern.
*   **Solution:** The `parse_rooignore` function in `indexer.py` was modified to correctly strip trailing slashes from patterns, ensuring directories like `.venv/` are properly ignored.

## 7. Persistent File Processing Errors

*   **Issue:** The script was failing with `UnprocessableEntityError` from the embedding service, preceded by errors related to parsing Markdown (`partition_md() is not available`) and JSON (`Not a valid ndjson`) files.
*   **Analysis:** This indicated a deep-seated issue with the `unstructured` library and its dependencies in the current environment. Despite attempts to reinstall packages, the library was failing to correctly parse certain file types, leading to malformed data being sent to the embedding service.
*   **Final Solution:** To create the most robust solution, the script was refactored to bypass the `unstructured` library entirely. The final version reads all allowed file types as plain text, ensuring a consistent and valid data format is always sent for embedding. This resolved all remaining errors.
