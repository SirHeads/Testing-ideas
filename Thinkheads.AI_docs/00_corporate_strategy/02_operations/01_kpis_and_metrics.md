# KPIs and Metrics

To measure the success and health of the project, we will track a combination of business-oriented Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and technical performance metrics.

## Business KPIs

Business KPIs focus on the overall value and impact of the project. Success is measured by:

- **User Adoption and Engagement:** Tracking the number of active users and the frequency of use for deployed applications.
- **Project Milestone Completion:** Adherence to the project roadmap and timely delivery of key features.
- **Community Feedback:** Qualitative analysis of user feedback and suggestions.

## Technical Metrics

Technical metrics focus on the operational performance and stability of the systems. Success is measured by:

- **System Uptime and Reliability:** Aiming for 99.9% uptime for all services.
- **Application Performance:** Monitoring response times and resource utilization to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Code Quality:** Maintaining a high standard of code through automated testing and continuous integration practices.
