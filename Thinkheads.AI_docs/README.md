# Thinkheads.AI Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Thinkheads.AI project. This repository contains all of the technical and strategic documentation for the Phoenix Hypervisor, our automated platform for AI/ML/DL development and deployment.

## Project Overview

The Thinkheads.AI project is a comprehensive platform for building, testing, and deploying AI-driven applications. It is built on a foundation of open-source technologies and is designed to be a showcase of modern AI/ML/DL best practices.

## Phoenix Hypervisor

The Phoenix Hypervisor is the core of the Thinkheads.AI project. It is a Proxmox-based virtualization platform that is fully automated and managed by a declarative, configuration-driven orchestration system. The Phoenix Hypervisor is designed to be:

*   **Idempotent:** The orchestration scripts can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
*   **Modular:** The system is composed of a series of modular, single-purpose scripts that are easy to extend and maintain.
*   **Scalable:** The platform is designed to scale to support a growing number of containers and a variety of use cases.
*   **Secure:** The system is secured with a multi-layered security approach that includes AppArmor, firewalls, and unprivileged containers.

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

*   **`00_corporate_strategy`:** High-level corporate strategy documents.
