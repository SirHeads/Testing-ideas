# Business Case: Meeting Room

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-17
**Author:** TBD
**Status:** Approved

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Meeting Room V0 project aims to develop an AI-powered virtual meeting tool for ThinkHeads.ai. This tool will facilitate agenda planning, action item tracking, and provide LLM-driven insights to significantly enhance meeting productivity. As a solo, non-commercial endeavor, its primary focus is on advancing AI/ML/DL skills and strengthening the developer's portfolio for improved employability within the AI industry. By leveraging existing resources such as Proxmox, Linode, and various open-source tools, the project minimizes costs while maximizing learning opportunities and professional visibility. The project has been prioritized due to its technical complexity and strong portfolio appeal (scoring 4.2 in the Project Selection Criteria), with an MVP targeted for completion by April 2026, as outlined in the Project Roadmap. This business case details the project's concept, estimated costs, anticipated benefits, potential risks, and its strategic alignment, thereby justifying its development.

## 2. Problem Statement

The core problem this project addresses is the inefficiency and lack of actionable insights often experienced in virtual meetings. Without a structured approach, meetings can lack clear agendas, action items are frequently lost or forgotten, and valuable information within meeting notes remains untapped. This leads to decreased productivity, missed opportunities, and a slower pace of skill development in critical AI/ML areas. The developer, as the primary stakeholder, is directly affected by the need to efficiently manage personal projects and to build a compelling portfolio for potential employers. Not solving this problem would result in continued suboptimal meeting outcomes, a slower acquisition of advanced AI/ML skills, and a less competitive professional portfolio, ultimately hindering career advancement in the AI industry.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is the "Meeting Room," an AI-driven tool integrated into ThinkHeads.ai. It will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) like Ollama, enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), to automate and improve various aspects of meeting management.

*   **Concept:** The core idea is to create an intelligent virtual meeting assistant that can generate structured agendas, track action items, and extract meaningful insights from meeting notes using AI. This will streamline personal meeting management and serve as a robust demonstration of advanced AI capabilities.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Agenda Generation (F07):** Automatically create structured meeting agendas.
    *   **Action Item Tracking (F08):** Identify, track, and manage action items discussed during meetings.
    *   **Meeting Insights (F09):** Provide LLM-driven summaries and insights from meeting notes.
*   **Scope (In/Out):**
    *   **In Scope:** Agenda generation (F07), action item tracking (F08), and meeting insights (F09) as per Feature Backlog. Non-functional requirements include low-latency responses (<2s for LLM queries), secure data storage, and 99% uptime. The technical stack will include Ollama, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and n8n, hosted on Proxmox and Linode.
    *   **Out of Scope:** Commercialization, multi-user collaboration features beyond personal use, complex user authentication systems (initially), and integration with third-party calendar applications (initially).

## 6. Technical Overview

The Meeting Room project will be built upon a robust and modern technical foundation, leveraging existing infrastructure and open-source technologies.

*   **Architecture:** The planned architecture involves an LLM (Ollama) with RAG capabilities for natural language processing and insight generation, a PostgreSQL database for structured data storage (agendas, action items, meeting notes), and a FastAPI backend for exposing APIs. n8n will be used for automation and workflow orchestration. The system will be hosted across a Proxmox server (for LLM and database) and Linode cloud instances (for lightweight APIs).
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **LLM:** Ollama (with RAG)
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL
    *   **API Framework:** FastAPI
    *   **Automation:** n8n
    *   **Hosting:** Proxmox (on-premise), Linode (cloud)
    *   **Networking/CDN:** Cloudflare (free tier)
*   **Dependencies:** The project depends on the existing Proxmox and Linode infrastructure. It also relies on the availability and performance of open-source tools like Ollama, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and n8n. Specific GPU resources on Proxmox will be required for Ollama tasks, necessitating careful scheduling to avoid conflicts with other sub-products.
