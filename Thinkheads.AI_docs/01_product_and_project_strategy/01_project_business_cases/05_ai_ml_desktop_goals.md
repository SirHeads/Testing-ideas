This document outlines the primary goals for the AI/ML Desktop Environment project.

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Leverage LXC containers to minimize overhead and maximize resource allocation for AI/ML workloads, ensuring that the dual NVIDIA 5060 Ti GPUs are used effectively.
- **High-Performance Remote Access:** Implement a self-hosted RustDesk solution to provide a smooth, low-latency remote desktop experience, enabling seamless interaction with the GUI-based applications and development tools.
- **Robust GPU Passthrough:** Configure and validate NVIDIA GPU passthrough to the LXC container, allowing for full CUDA and NVENC acceleration for machine learning, data processing, and video encoding tasks.
- **Scalability and Replicability:** Establish a standardized and automated setup process that allows for the quick deployment of multiple, identical AI/ML desktop environments.
- **Strong Security and Isolation:** Utilize unprivileged containers and best practices for container security to ensure that the desktop environment is isolated from the Proxmox host and other containers.
- **Comprehensive Tooling:** Install and configure a complete suite of AI/ML tools, including CUDA, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Jupyter, to create a ready-to-use environment for development and experimentation.
