# Architectural Principles

The architectural principles guiding ThinkHeads.ai's technical strategy ensure a robust, efficient, and maintainable platform for AI/ML/DL development and deployment. These principles are derived from the operational and technological choices made across the project.

## Modularity and Reusability
*   **Principle**: Components are designed as independent, interchangeable modules that can be easily integrated and reused across different parts of the system.
*   **Application**: Achieved through the extensive use of LXC containers and Docker environments, which provide isolated and portable execution contexts for various services (e.g., `dockProd1` for LLMs, `dockProd2` for image processing, `dockTest1` for testing). This promotes clear separation of concerns and simplifies maintenance and updates.

## Idempotency
*   **Principle**: Operations and deployments are designed to produce the same result regardless of how many times they are executed, ensuring consistency and reliability.
*   **Application**: Supported by scripted deployments and automated workflows managed by tools like n8n. This ensures that infrastructure provisioning, application updates, and data backups are repeatable and yield predictable outcomes, minimizing configuration drift and errors.

## Configuration as Code
*   **Principle**: Infrastructure and application configurations are managed as version-controlled code, enabling automated provisioning, consistent environments, and clear audit trails.
*   **Application**: Evident in the outlining and showcasing of hardware selection, software stack, model evaluation, server and environment design, and scripted deployments. This approach ensures that the entire technical setup can be reproduced and managed programmatically, enhancing transparency and control.

## Open-Source First
*   **Principle**: Prioritize the adoption and integration of free and open-source software solutions to minimize costs, foster community collaboration, and leverage a vast ecosystem of tools and innovations. Proprietary solutions are acceptable if they are industry standards or provide a distinct, unique advantage (e.g., NVIDIA drivers for GPU acceleration).
*   **Application**: A cornerstone of the ThinkHeads.ai project, driven by a zero-revenue model and a commitment to cost-efficiency. Key technologies like Proxmox, Ollama, FastAPI, n8n, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Hugo, and RustDesk are all open-source, enabling powerful capabilities without significant financial investment.
