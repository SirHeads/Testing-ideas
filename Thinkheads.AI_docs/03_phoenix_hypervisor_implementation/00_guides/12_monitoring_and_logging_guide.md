# Monitoring and Logging Guide

This guide provides an overview of the monitoring and logging capabilities of the Phoenix Hypervisor.

## 1. Introduction to Monitoring

The Phoenix Hypervisor includes a set of health check scripts that can be used to monitor the status of containers and services. These scripts are located in the `bin/health_checks` directory.

## 2. How to Use the Health Check Scripts

The health check scripts can be run from the command line using the `phoenix_orchestrator.sh` script. To run the health checks for a specific container, use the following command:

```bash
./phoenix_orchestrator.sh --health-check CTID
```

Where `CTID` is the ID of the container you want to check.

## 3. Configuration of Logging

Logging for containers and services is configured using the `phoenix_hypervisor_config.json` file. The `log_level` parameter can be set to one of the following values:

*   `debug`
*   `info`
*   `warn`
*   `error`

## 4. Integration with External Monitoring Tools

The Phoenix Hypervisor can be integrated with external monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. The health check scripts can be configured to output metrics in a format that can be scraped by Prometheus.
