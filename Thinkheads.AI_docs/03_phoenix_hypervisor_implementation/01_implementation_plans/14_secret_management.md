# Secret Management

## 1. Introduction

This document describes a potential design for a secret management system for the Phoenix Hypervisor. The current approach of storing sensitive information, such as API tokens and credentials, in configuration files poses a security risk. This enhancement would introduce a secure and centralized solution for managing secrets.

**Note:** This feature is currently under consideration for future development and is not implemented in the current version.

## 2. Problem Statement

Storing secrets in plaintext configuration files is a significant security vulnerability. This practice exposes sensitive information to anyone with access to the file system and makes secret rotation and auditing difficult. The key issues with the current approach are:

*   **Security Risk**: Secrets are stored in an insecure manner, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
*   **Lack of Auditing**: There is no way to audit who has accessed or modified secrets.
*   **Difficult Secret Rotation**: Changing a secret requires manually updating configuration files, which is error-prone and difficult to manage at scale.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A potential future solution is to integrate the Phoenix Hypervisor with a dedicated secret management solution, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. This would provide a centralized and secure repository for all secrets. The `phoenix_orchestrator.sh` script could be modified to retrieve secrets from the vault at runtime, rather than reading them from configuration files.
