# Dynamic IP Address Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a proposal for integrating dynamic IP address management into the Phoenix Hypervisor system. The current IP address assignment is static and requires manual configuration in the JSON files. This enhancement would automate the allocation and management of IP addresses for newly provisioned resources.

**Note:** This feature is currently under consideration for future development and is not implemented in the current version. All IP addresses must be assigned statically in the configuration files.

## 2. Problem Statement

Currently, the configuration files require a static IP address to be defined for each container and VM. This manual process has several drawbacks:

*   **Administrative Overhead**: Administrators must manually track and assign IP addresses.
*   **Risk of IP Conflicts**: Manual assignment increases the risk of IP address conflicts.
*   **Scalability Challenges**: Managing a static IP address scheme becomes more complex as the number of resources grows.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A potential future solution is to implement a dynamic IP address management system. The orchestrator could be enhanced to automatically assign an available IP address from a predefined pool to each new container or VM. This would eliminate the need for manual IP address assignment in the configuration files.
