# Advanced Configuration Validation

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a potential design for an advanced configuration validation system for the Phoenix Hypervisor. The goal is to supplement the existing JSON schema validation with more sophisticated logical checks to prevent common configuration errors and improve the robustness of the container provisioning process.

**Note:** This feature is currently under consideration for future development and is not implemented in the current version of the `phoenix_orchestrator.sh` script.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current configuration validation relies on JSON schemas, which are effective for verifying the structure and data types of the configuration files. However, they cannot detect logical inconsistencies or invalid combinations of parameters. This can lead to failed container deployments that are difficult to diagnose.

Examples of issues not caught by JSON schema validation include:
*   Assigning a GPU to a container that does not have the `nvidia` feature enabled.
*   Inconsistent network configurations, such as a static IP address outside the specified subnet.
*   Missing dependencies between features (e.g., a feature that requires another feature to be installed first).
*   Allocation of resources (CPU, memory) that exceed the hypervisor's capacity.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A potential solution is the implementation of an advanced validation module within the `phoenix_orchestrator.sh` script. This module would execute a series of logical checks against the configuration files before any provisioning actions are taken. If any validation check fails, the orchestrator would exit with a descriptive error message, preventing the system from entering an inconsistent state.
