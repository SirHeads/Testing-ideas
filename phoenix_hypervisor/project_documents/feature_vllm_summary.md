The `vllm` feature automates the installation of the vLLM library, a high-throughput engine for LLM inference. This script prepares a container to serve large language models efficiently.

## Key Actions

1.  **Dependency Installation:** Installs `python3-pip`, the primary prerequisite for installing vLLM.
2.  **vLLM Installation:** Installs the `vllm` library and its dependencies using `pip3`.
3.  **Verification:** Performs a simple verification by checking the help output of the vLLM API server entrypoint. This confirms that the package was installed correctly and is executable.
4.  **Idempotency:** The script checks if the `vllm` pip package is already installed before taking any action, ensuring it can be re-run safely.

## Usage

This feature is applied to any container that will be used to host a vLLM-based inference server. It should be applied after the `nvidia` and `docker` features, as it relies on a Python environment and often runs in a containerized, GPU-accelerated setup.
