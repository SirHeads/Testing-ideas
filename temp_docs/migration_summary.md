## 1. Project Overview

This document summarizes the successful migration of the qdrant vector database from a dedicated LXC container to a centralized Docker environment managed by Portainer. The project's primary goal was to consolidate the system architecture, improve manageability, and align with the new "Centralized Declarative Provisioning" model.

## 2. Key Objectives

*   **Decommission Legacy LXC Containers:** Retire the dedicated LXC containers for qdrant and other services (950, 951, 952, 953).
*   **Centralize Docker Management:** Consolidate all Dockerized services onto a single, dedicated VM (`Dr-Phoenix`).
*   **Implement Declarative Provisioning:** Utilize the `phoenix-cli` to manage the infrastructure and Portainer for application deployment.
*   **Update System Documentation:** Ensure all architectural diagrams, service descriptions, and operational guides reflect the new, simplified architecture.

## 3. Final Outcome

The migration was completed successfully, resulting in a more streamlined and robust architecture. The new `Dr-Phoenix` VM (1002) now hosts the qdrant service, managed by Portainer on VM 1001. All relevant system documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

The new architecture is simpler, more secure, and easier to manage, providing a solid foundation for future development.
