# NGINX Service-by-Service Analysis

This document contains a detailed analysis of each service proxied by the NGINX gateway.

---

## 1. n8n (`n8n_proxy`)

### 1.1. Current Configuration

*   **Routing:** The service is available at `https://n8n.phoenix.local`. HTTP requests are correctly redirected to HTTPS. All requests under the root (`/`) are passed to the backend.
*   **Upstream:** A single backend server is defined at `10.0.0.154:5678`.
*   **Security:** SSL/TLS is enabled with modern protocols (TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3) and a specified cipher suite. It includes headers for WebSocket support. However, `proxy_ssl_verify` is set to `off`, meaning NGINX does not verify the SSL certificate of the backend n8n service.
*   **Performance:** `http2` is enabled, which is good for performance. WebSocket support is correctly configured. No caching is implemented.
*   **Logging:** Uses the default NGINX logs.

### 1.2. Areas for Improvement

*   **Security:** The most significant area for improvement is the lack of upstream certificate verification (`proxy_ssl_verify off`). This creates a potential security gap between the gateway and the service. Additionally, standard security headers (HSTS, etc.) are missing.
*   **Performance:** The application's frontend performance could be improved by caching static assets (like CSS, JavaScript, images).
*   **Reliability:** There is a single point of failure in the upstream definition. If the `n8n` service goes down, the gateway has no mechanism to detect this and will continue to send requests, resulting in errors for the user.

### 1.3. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Enable Upstream SSL Verification:** If the n8n service uses SSL, configure NGINX to trust its certificate and change `proxy_ssl_verify` to `on`. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks on the internal network.
    *   **Implement HSTS:** Add a `Strict-Transport-Security` header to ensure browsers only connect via HTTPS.
    *   **Add Security Headers:** Implement `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and a basic `Content-Security-Policy` to protect against clickjacking and XSS attacks.

2.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Cache Static Assets:** Add a `location` block with a regex to match common static file extensions and apply a `proxy_cache` and `expires` directive to reduce load on the backend and speed up page loads.

3.  **Reliability:**
    *   **Add Health Checks:** Implement an active health check on the upstream server. This allows NGINX to monitor the health of the n8n service and stop sending traffic if it becomes unresponsive.

## 2. Portainer (`portainer_proxy`)

### 2.1. Current Configuration

*   **Routing:** The service is available at `https://portainer.phoenix.local`. HTTP requests are correctly redirected to HTTPS. All requests under the root (`/`) are passed to the backend.
*   **Upstream:** A single backend server is defined at `10.0.0.99:9443`.
*   **Security:** SSL/TLS is enabled with modern protocols (TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3) and a specified cipher suite. It includes headers for WebSocket support. `proxy_ssl_verify` is set to `off`, which is a security risk.
*   **Performance:** `http2` is enabled. WebSocket support is correctly configured. No caching is implemented.
*   **Logging:** Uses the default NGINX logs.

### 2.2. Areas for Improvement

*   **Security:** The disabled upstream certificate verification (`proxy_ssl_verify off`) is a significant security gap. Standard security headers (HSTS, etc.) are also missing.
*   **Reliability:** The single upstream server is a single point of failure.

### 2.3. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Enable Upstream SSL Verification:** Configure NGINX to trust the Portainer service's SSL certificate and set `proxy_ssl_verify` to `on`.
    *   **Implement HSTS:** Add a `Strict-Transport-Security` header.
    *   **Add Security Headers:** Implement `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and a `Content-Security-Policy`.

2.  **Reliability:**
    *   **Add Health Checks:** Implement an active health check on the upstream server to ensure NGINX only sends traffic to a healthy Portainer instance.

## 3. Ollama (`ollama_proxy`)

### 3.1. Current Configuration

*   **Routing:** The service is available at `http://10.0.0.153/ollama/`. It listens on port 80 and proxies requests to the Ollama service.
*   **Upstream:** A single backend server is defined at `10.0.0.155:11434`.
*   **Security:** There is no SSL/TLS configured for this endpoint, meaning traffic between the client and the gateway is unencrypted.
*   **Performance:** WebSocket support is configured. No caching is implemented.
*   **Logging:** Uses the default NGINX logs.

### 3.2. Areas for Improvement

*   **Security:** The lack of SSL/TLS is a major security concern. All traffic to this endpoint is in cleartext.
*   **Reliability:** The single upstream server is a single point of failure.
*   **Access Control:** The service is open to the entire network. Depending on the use case, some form of authentication or IP-based access control might be necessary.

### 3.3. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Implement SSL/TLS:** Secure the endpoint with a valid SSL certificate. This is the highest priority.
    *   **Add Authentication:** If this is a sensitive service, consider adding a layer of authentication, such as HTTP Basic Auth or OAuth2 Proxy.

2.  **Reliability:**
    *   **Add Health Checks:** Implement an active health check on the upstream server.

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   **Use `upstream` block:** For consistency and readability, define the Ollama backend in an `upstream` block, similar to the other services.

## 4. vLLM Gateway (`vllm_gateway`)

### 4.1. Current Configuration

*   **Routing:** This is the most complex configuration. It listens on port 80 and routes requests to different backends based on the URL path and the `model` field in the JSON payload of the request. It handles multiple services, including `vLLM`, `Qdrant`, `n8n`, `Open WebUI`, `Ollama`, and `Llama.cpp`.
*   **Upstream:** Multiple upstream blocks are defined for each service.
*   **Security:** There is no SSL/TLS configured. The `http.js` script parses the request body, which could be a security risk if not handled carefully (potential for denial of service via large payloads).
*   **Performance:** The dynamic routing based on the request body is a powerful feature, but it adds overhead to each request. No caching is implemented for the API endpoints.
*   **Logging:** A custom log format (`vllm_logs`) is defined, which is excellent for debugging and monitoring. It captures the model name and the target upstream.

### 4.2. Areas for Improvement

*   **Security:** The lack of SSL/TLS is a critical security issue. The `js_set` directive, while powerful, can have performance and security implications that need to be carefully managed.
*   **Reliability:** There are multiple single points of failure, one for each upstream service.
*   **Maintainability:** The single, large configuration file is becoming complex. As more services are added, it will become increasingly difficult to manage. The routing logic is split between the `map` directive and multiple `location` blocks, which can be confusing.
*   **Redundancy:** The `ollama_proxy` and the `/ollama/` location block in `vllm_gateway` appear to be redundant.

### 4.3. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Implement SSL/TLS:** This is the highest priority. Secure the entire gateway with a valid SSL certificate.
    *   **Input Validation:** Add checks in the `http.js` script to handle potential errors and malformed JSON gracefully. Limit the size of the request body that NGINX will read into the buffer.

2.  **Reliability:**
    *   **Add Health Checks:** Implement active health checks for all upstream services.
    *   **Load Balancing:** For critical services like the vLLM models, consider running multiple instances and using NGINX for load balancing.

3.  **Maintainability:**
    *   **Split Configuration:** Break the monolithic `vllm_gateway` file into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example, create separate configuration files for each service and include them in the main server block.
    *   **Consolidate Endpoints:** Consolidate the `ollama_proxy` into the main gateway configuration to avoid duplication.

4.  **Performance:**
    *   **API Caching:** For idempotent API endpoints (like fetching model information), consider implementing a caching layer to reduce the load on the backend services.

## 5. Qdrant (`vllm_gateway`)

### 5.1. Current Configuration

*   **Routing:** The service is available at `/qdrant/` within the `vllm_gateway` server block.
*   **Upstream:** A single backend server is defined at `10.0.0.152:6334`.
*   **Security:** As part of the `vllm_gateway`, this endpoint is not currently encrypted with SSL/TLS.
*   **Performance:** No specific performance optimizations are in place for this service.
*   **Logging:** Uses the custom `vllm_logs` format.

### 5.2. Areas for Improvement

*   **Security:** The lack of SSL/TLS is the primary security concern.
*   **Reliability:** The single upstream server is a single point of failure.
*   **Isolation:** While it's efficient to have a single gateway, for a critical service like a database, it might be worth considering if it needs a separate, more restricted access policy.

### 5.3. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Implement SSL/TLS:** Secure the main gateway endpoint.
    *   **Access Control:** If the Qdrant API should not be publicly exposed, implement IP-based access restrictions or another form of authentication.

2.  **Reliability:**
    *   **Add Health Checks:** Implement an active health check on the Qdrant upstream.
    *   **Clustering:** For a production environment, consider setting up a Qdrant cluster for high availability and load balancing. NGINX can then be configured to route requests to the cluster.
