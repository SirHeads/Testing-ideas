# AppArmor Implementation Analysis Report

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the findings of a smoke test walkthrough of the AppArmor implementation for the Phoenix Hypervisor. The analysis focused on the configuration and application of AppArmor profiles for LXC containers, with a specific focus on container 951.

## 2. Files Analyzed

*   `usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/bin/phoenix_orchestrator.sh`
*   `usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/etc/phoenix_lxc_configs.json`
*   `usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/etc/apparmor/lxc-gpu-docker-storage`
*   `usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/bin/hypervisor_setup/hypervisor_feature_setup_apparmor.sh`

## 3. Smoke Test Walkthrough

The walkthrough simulated the execution of the `phoenix_orchestrator.sh` script for container 951. The key steps are as follows:

1.  The `phoenix_orchestrator.sh` script is executed for container 951.
2.  The main state machine calls the `apply_configurations` function.
3.  The `apply_configurations` function calls the `apply_apparmor_profile` function.
4.  The `apply_apparmor_profile` function reads the `phoenix_lxc_configs.json` file to get the `apparmor_profile` for container 951, which is `lxc-gpu-docker-storage`.
5.  The function then modifies the container's configuration file (`/etc/pve/lxc/951.conf`) to apply the AppArmor profile and add the necessary `idmap` and `cgroup2` rules for GPU and Docker support.
6.  The `hypervisor_feature_setup_apparmor.sh` script ensures that the `lxc-gpu-docker-storage` profile is deployed to the hypervisor's AppArmor directory (`/etc/apparmor.d/`).

The walkthrough confirms that the AppArmor profile is correctly applied to the container as intended.

## 4. Potential Issues and Recommendations

### 4.1. Overly Permissive Storage Access

*   **Issue**: The `lxc-gpu-docker-storage` profile contains the rule `/mnt/shared/** rwm`, which grants read, write, and execute permissions to all files and directories under `/mnt/shared`. This is overly permissive and could allow a compromised container to access or modify sensitive data in the shared storage.
*   **Recommendation**: Restrict the storage access to only the specific directories and files that the container needs. For example, if the container only needs access to `/mnt/shared/models`, the rule should be changed to `/mnt/shared/models/** rwm`.

### 4.2. Lack of Auditing

*   **Issue**: The AppArmor profile does not include any audit rules. This makes it difficult to monitor for and detect potential security violations.
*   **Recommendation**: Add audit rules to the profile to log any denied actions. This will provide valuable information for security monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 4.3. No Network Rules

*   **Issue**: The AppArmor profile does not define any network rules, which means the container's network access is not restricted by AppArmor.
*   **Recommendation**: Add network rules to the profile to restrict the container's network access to only the necessary ports and protocols. This will provide an additional layer of security.

## 5. Conclusion

The AppArmor implementation is functional and correctly applies the specified profiles to the containers. However, there are several areas where the security posture could be improved by implementing more restrictive rules and adding auditing and network rules.
