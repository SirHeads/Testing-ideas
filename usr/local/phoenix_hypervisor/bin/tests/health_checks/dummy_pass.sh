# Description: This is a simple dummy test script that is designed to always
#              succeed. It prints a success message and exits with a zero status
#              code. It is used for testing the basic functionality of the main
#              test runner (`test_runner.sh`) to ensure it can correctly execute
#              a script and register its successful completion.
#
# Dependencies: None.
#
# Inputs: None.
#
# Outputs:
#   - Exits with status 0.
#   - Prints a success message to stdout.
#

# Print a message to standard output to confirm execution.
