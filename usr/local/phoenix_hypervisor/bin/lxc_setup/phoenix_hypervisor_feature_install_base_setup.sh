# File: phoenix_hypervisor_feature_install_base_setup.sh
# Description: This script serves as the foundational modular feature installer for all new LXC containers
#              within the Phoenix Hypervisor ecosystem. Its primary role, as defined in the `features` array
#              of `phoenix_lxc_configs.json`, is to establish a consistent and standardized baseline
#              operating system environment. It automates the installation of essential packages
#              (e.g., curl, wget, vim, htop, jq, git) and configures the system locale to en_US.UTF-8.
#              This ensures that any container, regardless of its final application, starts from a known,
#              stable, and correctly configured state. The script is designed to be idempotent, meaning
#              it can be run multiple times without causing adverse effects, making it a reliable component
#              of the main phoenix_orchestrator.sh workflow.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - phoenix_hypervisor_common_utils.sh: Provides shared functions for logging, command execution, and error handling.
#   - Core system binaries: dpkg, apt-get, grep, bash, locale-gen, update-locale.
#
# Inputs:
#   - $1 (CTID): The unique Container ID for the target LXC container that requires the base setup.
#
# Outputs:
#   - Logs package installation and locale configuration details to stdout and the main log file.
#   - Modifies the container's filesystem by installing packages and setting the locale.
#   - Returns exit code 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

CTID=""

# =====================================================================================
# Function: parse_arguments
# Description: Validates and parses the command-line arguments provided to the script.
#              It expects exactly one argument: the CTID of the target LXC container.
#              This function is critical for ensuring the script targets the correct container
#              for the base OS setup.
# Arguments:
#   $1 - The Container ID (CTID) for the LXC container.
# Globals:
#   - CTID: This global variable is set with the value of $1.
# Returns:
#   - None. The script will exit with status 2 if the required argument is missing.
# =====================================================================================
parse_arguments() {
    # Ensure that the script is called with the Container ID (CTID) as the first argument.
    if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
        log_error "Usage: $0 <CTID>"
        log_error "This script requires the LXC Container ID as an argument to perform the base OS setup."

}

# =====================================================================================
# Function: perform_base_os_setup
# Description: Orchestrates the core logic for the base OS setup within the target LXC container.
#              This function handles two main responsibilities:
#              1. Package Management: It checks for a list of essential packages and installs any that are missing.
#                 This uses an idempotency check to avoid reinstalling packages, making the process efficient.
#              2. Locale Configuration: It sets the system-wide locale to en_US.UTF-8, which is a standard
#                 prerequisite for many applications to function correctly.
# Arguments:
#   None. It relies on the global CTID variable set by `parse_arguments`.
# Returns:
#   - None. The script will exit via `exit_script` if a critical command fails,
#     thanks to `set -e` and the error handling in `pct_exec`.

# Function: main
# Description: The main entry point for the script execution. It orchestrates the
#              workflow by calling the necessary functions in the correct order:
#              1. Parse command-line arguments to get the CTID.
#              2. Perform the base OS setup, including package installation and locale configuration.
#              3. Exit with a success status.
# Arguments:
#   $@ - All command-line arguments passed to the script, which are then forwarded
#        to the `parse_arguments` function.
# Returns:
#   - Exits with status 0 on successful completion of all tasks.
