# File: hypervisor-manager.sh
# Description: This script is responsible for the initial setup and configuration of the Proxmox hypervisor.
#              It is designed to be called by the central 'phoenix' dispatcher and acts as the dedicated manager
#              for all hypervisor-level operations. The script reads its configuration from a JSON file and
#              executes a series of modular setup scripts in a predefined order to ensure a consistent and
#              reproducible hypervisor environment.
#
#              Key responsibilities include:
#              - Initial system setup (packages, users, etc.).
#              - ZFS storage pool and dataset configuration.
#              - Hardware passthrough setup (VFIO for GPUs).
#              - NVIDIA driver installation and initialization.
#              - Network and firewall configuration.
#              - Shared resource provisioning (NFS, Samba).
#              - AppArmor profile setup and system tuning.
#
# Inputs:
#   --config <path>: (Required) The path to the hypervisor configuration JSON file. This is passed by the 'phoenix' dispatcher.
#   --wipe-disks:    (Optional) A dangerous flag that enables destructive ZFS setup mode. Use with caution. This is passed by the 'phoenix' dispatcher.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - phoenix_hypervisor_common_utils.sh: A library of shared shell functions.
#   - A series of setup scripts located in 'usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/bin/hypervisor_setup/'.

# --- SCRIPT INITIALIZATION ---
# Determines the absolute directory of the script and the base directory of the Phoenix Hypervisor project.
# This ensures that all paths are relative to the project root, making the system portable.

# --- SOURCE COMMON UTILITIES ---
# Sources the common utilities script, which provides a centralized library of functions for logging,
# error handling, and other common tasks, ensuring consistency across the system.

# Function: setup_hypervisor
# Description: Orchestrates the initial setup of the Proxmox hypervisor by executing a
#              predefined sequence of modular setup scripts. This function ensures that all
#              components of the hypervisor are installed and configured in the correct order.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - The path to the hypervisor configuration file.
#
# Returns:
#   None. The function will call log_fatal and exit if any of the setup scripts fail.
