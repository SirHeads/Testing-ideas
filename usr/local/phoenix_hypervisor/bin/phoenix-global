# phoenix-global - Global Wrapper for the Phoenix Hypervisor CLI
#
# This script allows the 'phoenix' command to be run from any directory.
# It determines the location of the main 'phoenix' script and executes it,
# passing along all command-line arguments. This provides a seamless
# experience, making it feel like the 'phoenix' command is installed
# globally.
#
# To use this script, create a symbolic link to it from a directory in your
# system's $PATH. For example:
# sudo ln -s /usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/bin/phoenix-global /usr/local/bin/phoenix
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Determine the absolute path of the script's directory to ensure reliable
# execution of the main phoenix script, regardless of where this script is
# called from.
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Execute the main phoenix script, passing all command-line arguments ("$@").
