# Unhealthy Container Report

## 1. Summary

This report details the failure of containers 951 (vllm-granite-embed) and 952 (qdrant-lxc) to pass the health check, as identified by the `verify_container_health.sh` script. This issue indicates a critical failure in the container startup and initialization process, which has significant architectural implications.

## 2. Problem Description

The health check script, located at `/usr/local/phoenix_hypervisor/bin/verify_container_health.sh`, was executed to verify the status of all containers. The script reported the following:

- **Container 951 (vllm-granite-embed):** Unhealthy
- **Container 952 (qdrant-lxc):** Unhealthy
- **Container 953 (api-gateway-lxc):** Healthy

The unhealthy status of containers 951 and 952 indicates that they are not functioning as expected and are likely unable to serve their intended purpose within the system.

## 3. Architectural Impact

The failure of these containers has the following architectural impact:

- **Vector Embedding Service (Container 951):** The `vllm-granite-embed` container is responsible for generating vector embeddings for text data. Its failure means that no new data can be processed and indexed, which is a core function of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
- **Vector Database (Container 952):** The `qdrant-lxc` container serves as the vector database, storing and retrieving the embeddings generated by container 951. Its failure means that no vector search queries can be executed, rendering the entire RAG system non-operational.

The failure of these two containers constitutes a complete outage of the RAG functionality, which is a critical component of the Phoenix Hypervisor's AI capabilities.

## 4. Proposed Resolution

A multi-step resolution plan is proposed to address this architectural failure:

1.  **Root Cause Analysis:** A thorough investigation is required to determine the root cause of the container failures. This should include:
    *   Analyzing container logs for errors.
    *   Verifying container configurations.
    *   Checking for resource allocation issues (CPU, memory, storage).
    *   Ensuring all dependencies are met.

2.  **Remediation Plan:** Based on the root cause analysis, a detailed remediation plan will be developed. This may involve:
    *   Correcting configuration errors.
    *   Rebuilding container images.
    *   Adjusting resource allocations.
    *   Updating startup scripts.

3.  **Verification and Validation:** Once the remediation plan is implemented, the health check script will be re-run to verify that containers 951 and 952 are reported as healthy. A full system test will then be conducted to validate that the RAG functionality is fully restored.

This issue should be treated as a high-priority incident, and a dedicated team should be assigned to execute the resolution plan.
