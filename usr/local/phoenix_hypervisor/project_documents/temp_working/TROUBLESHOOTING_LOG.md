# Troubleshooting Log: 502 Bad Gateway on Portainer and n8n

This log documents the step-by-step execution of the diagnostic plan to identify the root cause of the 502 Bad Gateway errors.


## Step 1: Verify Container Status and Logs

### Check the status of the Nginx gateway container (LXC 953)

**Command:**
```bash
pct status 953
```

**Output:**
```
status: running
```

**Analysis:**
The Nginx gateway container (LXC 953) is running as expected.


### Check the status of the Nginx service

**Command:**
```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

**Output:**
```
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; preset: enabled)

Sep 15 18:19:15 Nginx-VscodeRag systemd[1]: Started nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server.
```

**Analysis:**
The Nginx service is active and running, which means the issue is not with the service itself.


### Review the Nginx error logs

**Command:**
```bash
tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

**Output:**
```
2025/09/15 18:19:13 [notice] 780#780: using inherited sockets from "5;6;"
2025/09/15 19:09:46 [error] 906#906: *1 connect() failed (113: No route to host) while connecting to upstream, client: 10.0.0.236, server: _, request: "GET /home/workflows HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://10.0.0.151:8000/home/workflows", host: "n8n.phoenix.local"
2025/09/15 19:09:49 [error] 907#907: *3 connect() failed (113: No route to host) while connecting to upstream, client: 10.0.0.236, server: _, request: "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://10.0.0.151:8000/favicon.ico", host: "n8n.phoenix.local", referrer: "http://n8n.phoenix.local/home/workflows"
2025/09/15 19:09:53 [error] 909#909: *5 connect() failed (113: No route to host) while connecting to upstream, client: 10.0.0.236, server: _, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://10.0.0.151:8000/", host: "portainer.phoenix.local"
```

**Analysis:**
The logs show "No route to host" errors, indicating that the Nginx container cannot reach the upstream services for Portainer and n8n. This is a strong indicator of a network connectivity issue. The upstream IP for n8n is listed as `10.0.0.151`, which contradicts the diagnostic plan's expected IP of `10.0.0.154`. The Portainer IP is also listed as `10.0.0.151`, not `10.0.0.99`. This suggests a misconfiguration in the Nginx proxy files.


## Step 2: Validate Nginx Configuration

### Verify that the Portainer and n8n proxy configurations are enabled

**Command:**
```bash
ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

**Output:**
```
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 37 Sep 15 18:19 vllm_proxy -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/vllm_proxy
```

**Analysis:**
The `portainer_proxy` and `n8n_proxy` configurations are not enabled in the `sites-enabled` directory. This is the likely root cause of the 502 Bad Gateway errors, as Nginx is not configured to proxy requests to the Portainer and n8n services.
