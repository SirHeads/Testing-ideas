# File: network-config.template.yml
# Description: This Cloud-Init network configuration template is used by the phoenix_orchestrator.sh to dynamically
#              generate network settings for a new VM. The orchestrator replaces the placeholders (e.g., __IPV4_ADDRESS__)
#              with values from the 'network_config' section of a VM's definition in phoenix_vm_configs.json.
#              This declarative approach allows for the automated, consistent, and error-free application of network
#              configurations, supporting both static and DHCP setups during VM provisioning.
#
# Placeholders:
#   - __DHCP4_ENABLED__: Replaced with 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable DHCP for the primary network interface.
#   - __IPV4_ADDRESS__: Replaced with the static IPv4 address and subnet mask (e.g., '192.168.1.100/24').
#   - __IPV4_GATEWAY__: Replaced with the default gateway address for the VM.
#
# Usage:
#   The phoenix_orchestrator.sh script reads this template, performs a search-and-replace for the placeholders,
#   and saves the output to a temporary file. This generated file is then passed to the VM via the Cloud-Init
#   datasource to configure the guest operating system's network upon first boot.
