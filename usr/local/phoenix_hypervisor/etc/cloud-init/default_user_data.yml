# File: default_user_data.yml
# Description: This Cloud-Init user-data file provides a default configuration for creating a standard administrative user.
#              It is intended as a fallback or for simple VM provisioning scenarios where dynamic user generation is not required.
#              The phoenix_orchestrator.sh can use this file to ensure a consistent baseline user setup across multiple VMs.
#              For production or dynamic environments, it is recommended to use the user-data.template.yml to inject
#              user details from the phoenix_vm_configs.json file.
#
# Usage:
#   This file is typically applied to a VM's Cloud-Init configuration using the 'qm set' command by the orchestrator.
#   The placeholder '<INSERT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE>' must be replaced with a valid SSH public key before use
#   to enable secure, key-based authentication.
