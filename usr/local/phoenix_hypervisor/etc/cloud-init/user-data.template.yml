# File: user-data.template.yml
# Description: This is a comprehensive Cloud-Init user-data template for the dynamic provisioning of VMs
#              within the Phoenix Hypervisor ecosystem. The phoenix_orchestrator.sh script uses this template
#              to inject VM-specific configurations from phoenix_vm_configs.json, enabling fully automated
#              and customized deployments. It handles hostname setup, user creation, package installation
#              (like the QEMU Guest Agent), disk partitioning, and the execution of feature scripts.
#
# Placeholders:
#   - __HOSTNAME__: Replaced with the VM's hostname.
#   - __USERNAME__: Replaced with the primary administrative username.
#   - #FEATURE_FILES_PLACEHOLDER#: This is a special placeholder where the orchestrator injects a 'write_files'
#     block. This block contains the content of any feature scripts (e.g., feature_install_docker.sh)
#     that need to be run inside the VM.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. The orchestrator reads a VM's configuration from phoenix_vm_configs.json.
#   2. It replaces the placeholders in this template with the corresponding values.
#   3. It dynamically generates the 'write_files' section based on the 'features' array in the VM's config.
#   4. The final, rendered YAML is passed to the VM via the Cloud-Init datasource.
#   5. On first boot, the VM executes these directives to configure itself.
