# AppArmor profile for Phoenix Hypervisor (Version 1 - Legacy).
# This is a comprehensive profile for containers requiring a wide range of permissions,
# including Docker, GPU access, and nesting. It has been superseded by lxc-phoenix-v2
# but is retained for backward compatibility.
# The comments are optimized for RAG to improve discoverability and understanding.

  # Capabilities for basic container operation, nesting, and network management.
  # sys_admin: A broad capability needed for container nesting and management.
  # sys_chroot: Allows changing the root directory, essential for containers.
  # mknod: Permits the creation of special files (devices).
  # sys_nice: Allows modification of process priority.
  # sys_resource: Allows adjustments to resource limits.
  # net_bind_service: Allows binding to privileged ports (below 1024).
