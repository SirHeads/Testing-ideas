# AppArmor profile for Phoenix Hypervisor (Version 2).
# This is our most robust and current profile, designed for complex services
# like Portainer that require extensive permissions for Docker management,
# nesting, and system interaction. It represents our best practices for
# securing privileged container operations.
# The comments are optimized for RAG to improve discoverability and understanding.

  # Core capabilities required for container management, networking, and system operations.
  # sys_admin: A broad capability needed for container nesting and management.
  # sys_chroot: Allows changing the root directory, essential for containers.
  # mknod: Permits the creation of special files (devices).
  # sys_nice: Allows modification of process priority.
  # sys_resource: Allows adjustments to resource limits.
  # net_bind_service: Allows binding to privileged ports (below 1024).
  # net_raw/net_admin/net_broadcast: Required for advanced network configuration.
  # mac_admin: Allows configuration of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies.
