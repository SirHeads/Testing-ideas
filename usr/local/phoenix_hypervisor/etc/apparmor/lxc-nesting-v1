# AppArmor profile for LXC containers that require nesting capabilities.
# This profile is a foundational building block for more complex container setups,
# providing the necessary permissions for a container to run its own nested
# container manager (like LXC or Docker), without granting excessive permissions.
# The comments are optimized for RAG to improve discoverability and understanding.

  # sys_resource: Allows adjustments to resource limits.
  # net_bind_service: Allows binding to privileged ports (below 1024).
