# NGINX Gateway Analysis Plan

This document outlines the plan for a detailed analysis of the NGINX gateway, focusing on each proxied service individually.

## Objective

To understand the current configuration, identify areas for improvement, and propose actionable recommendations for each service to enhance security, performance, and reliability.

## Services for Analysis

*   n8n
*   Portainer
*   Ollama
*   vLLM Gateway (covering chat and embeddings)
*   Qdrant

## Analysis Framework (per service)

For each service, we will analyze the following aspects:

### 1. Current Configuration (`what are we doing now`)

*   **Routing:** How are requests routed to the backend? (server_name, location blocks)
*   **Upstream:** How is the backend service defined? (upstream blocks)
*   **Security:** What security measures are in place? (SSL/TLS, headers)
*   **Performance:** Are there any performance-related configurations? (caching, http2)
*   **Logging:** How are requests logged?

### 2. Areas for Improvement (`what could we be doing better`)

*   **Security Hardening:**
    *   SSL/TLS best practices (protocols, ciphers).
    *   Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
    *   Authentication/Authorization (is it needed?).
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Caching strategies.
    *   Load balancing (if applicable).
    *   Keepalive connections.
*   **Reliability and High Availability:**
    *   Health checks for upstreams.
    *   Failover mechanisms.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   Configuration clarity and comments.
    *   Use of variables and maps to reduce duplication.

### 3. Actionable Recommendations (`how could we improve`)

*   Specific configuration changes to implement.
*   Suggestions for new tools or processes.
*   Documentation updates.
