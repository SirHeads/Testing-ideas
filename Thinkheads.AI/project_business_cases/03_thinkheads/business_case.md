# Business Case: ThinkHeadsV0 (AI-Driven Website)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-17
**Author:** Solo Developer
**Status:** Approved

## 1. Executive Summary

The ThinkHeadsV0 project is the development of an AI-driven website for ThinkHeads.ai, serving as the central hub for showcasing sub-products (Learning Assistant, Meeting Room, Online Card Game, User Profiles) and portfolio content. The website features a chat-based navigation interface powered by an LLM (Ollama), designed to demonstrate AI/ML/DL expertise, build a professional portfolio, and enhance employability in the AI industry. As a solo, non-commercial project, the focus is on skill development and visibility rather than revenue, leveraging existing resources (Proxmox, Linode, open-source tools) to minimize costs. The project aligns with the 20-hour/week schedule, targeting an MVP by October 2025, per **3.2 Project_Roadmap.md**. This business case outlines the project idea, costs, benefits, risks, and strategic alignment to justify its prioritization.

## 2. Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by this project is the lack of a centralized, AI-driven platform to showcase the developer's AI/ML/DL expertise and portfolio content. Without this platform, there is a significant portfolio gap, reducing visibility and weakening job applications on platforms like X/LinkedIn. This also leads to a delay in gaining critical AI/ML/DL experience (LLM, RAG, APIs) and results in sub-products (e.g., Learning Assistant) remaining isolated without proper integration and user engagement. Ultimately, not pursuing this project limits community and employer exposure, hindering professional growth and opportunities.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A detailed description of the proposed project or initiative. This section should explain how the solution will address the problem statement.
*   **Concept:** The AI-driven website is a public-facing platform hosting static content (portfolio, blog) and dynamic features (LLM-powered chat navigation, sub-product integration). It showcases technical skills in AI/ML/DL, full-stack development, and system administration, serving as the entry point for ThinkHeads.ai sub-products.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Chat-based navigation (FR01)
    *   Portfolio hosting (FR02)
    *   Sub-product integration (FR03)
    *   Session management (FR04)
    *   Blog section (FR05)
*   **Scope (In/Out):**
    *   **In Scope:** Chat-based navigation (FR01), portfolio hosting (FR02), sub-product integration (FR03), session management (FR04), blog section (FR05). Non-functional requirements include 99% uptime, <2s page load time, and <2s chat response time (NFR01-NFR04).
    *   **Out of Scope:** TBD (e.g., advanced user authentication beyond session management, complex e-commerce features).

## 4. Alignment with Strategic Goals

This project is prioritized due to its high learning value (LLM, RAG) and portfolio impact, aligning with the developer's strategic goals of demonstrating AI/ML/DL expertise and enhancing employability. It ties into the non-commercial, portfolio-focused business model and meets the criteria for high learning and portfolio value as outlined in **3.1 Project_Selection_Criteria.md**.

---

## 5. Target Audience & User Personas

The primary stakeholder for this project is the developer (as a learner and creator). Secondary stakeholders include potential employers and the broader tech community. The public-facing portfolio and AI-driven features are specifically designed to attract and engage these secondary audiences, showcasing expertise and building a personal brand.

## 6. Technical Overview

*A high-level summary of the proposed technical implementation.*
*   **Architecture:** The website will utilize a static site generator (Hugo) for core content, served by Nginx. Dynamic features, such as LLM-powered chat navigation, will be handled by a FastAPI backend interacting with Ollama for LLM inference and PostgreSQL for data storage. Cloudflare will be used for caching and DNS, enhancing performance and security. n8n will be used for automation, including deployment and monitoring.
*   **Technology Stack:** Hugo, Nginx, FastAPI, Ollama, PostgreSQL, Cloudflare, n8n, RustDesk.
*   **Dependencies:** Proxmox server (for LLM and testing), Linode server (for hosting), existing Cloudflare account, open-source software.

---

## 7. Success Metrics & KPIs

*   **Portfolio Impact:** The AI-driven website will be featured as the central hub on ThinkHeads.ai by October 2025.
*   **Learning Outcome:** Master LLM integration (Ollama, RAG), FastAPI, and Hugo/Nginx by October 2025.
*   **Employer Engagement:** Achieve 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn by November 2025.
*   **Community Engagement:** Attract 100+ unique visitors to ThinkHeads.ai by February 2026.
*   **Performance:** Ensure 99% uptime, <2s page load time, and <2s chat response time.
*   **Implementation:** Deploy website MVP (FR01-FR03, NFR01-NFR04) by October 2025.

## 8. Business Value

*   **Portfolio Enhancement:** This project will establish a professional, AI-driven website on ThinkHeads.ai, serving as a central hub to showcase full-stack and AI expertise to employers, significantly strengthening the overall ThinkHeads.ai portfolio.
*   **Skill Development:** The project will enable the mastery of critical AI/ML/DL skills, including LLM integration (Ollama, RAG), API development (FastAPI), database management (PostgreSQL), and static site generation (Hugo).
*   **Community Engagement:** By attracting 100+ unique visitors by February 2026, the project will increase exposure in the tech community and help build a personal brand in AI/ML.
*   **Foundation:** The website will serve as the central hub for other sub-products, enabling their seamless integration and increasing their visibility.
*   **Automation:** Implementation of n8n workflows for deployment and monitoring will enhance operational efficiency for future projects.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk Description | Likelihood (Low/Med/High) | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Time Overrun | Medium | High | Adhere to 90-hour estimate, use n8n to automate repetitive tasks (e.g., deployment), and prioritize high-impact features (FR01-FR03). |
| Resource Constraints | Medium | Medium | Schedule GPU tasks on Proxmox (e.g., Ollama in `dockProd1`) to avoid conflicts; offload lightweight tasks to Linode. |
| Technical Challenges | Medium | Medium | Test LLM and APIs in `dockTest1` on Proxmox before deployment; leverage community resources for Ollama/FastAPI issues. |
| Limited Scalability | Low | Medium | Use Cloudflare caching to reduce Linodeâ€™s 4 GB RAM load; monitor performance with n8n. |
| Portfolio Gap (Not Doing) | High | High | Proceed with project to create central hub, enhancing visibility and job applications. |
| Learning Delay (Not Doing) | High | High | Proceed with project to gain critical AI/ML/DL experience. |
| Sub-Product Isolation (Not Doing) | High | Medium | Proceed with project to integrate sub-products and increase user engagement. |
| Missed Visibility (Not Doing) | Medium | Medium | Proceed with project to attract visitors and increase community/employer exposure. |
