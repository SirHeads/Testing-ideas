# Business Case: Online Card Game V0

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-17
**Author:** TBD (Self)
**Status:** Approved

## 1. Executive Summary

The Online Card Game V0 project aims to develop an AI-driven multiplayer card game integrated into ThinkHeads.ai. This project will incorporate educational AI/ML challenges to engage users and demonstrate technical expertise. As a solo, non-commercial endeavor, its primary focus is on advancing AI/ML/DL skills and enhancing the developer's portfolio for employability in the AI industry. By leveraging existing resources (Proxmox, Linode, open-source tools), the project minimizes costs while maximizing learning and visibility. Prioritized for its technical complexity and portfolio appeal (score: 4.0), the project targets an MVP by July 2026. This business case outlines the project idea, costs, benefits, risks, and strategic alignment to justify its development.

## 2. Problem Statement

The core problem this project addresses is the need for a practical, engaging platform to apply and showcase advanced AI/ML/DL skills, particularly in game development and real-time API integration. Without such a project, the developer's portfolio might lack a compelling, interactive demonstration of these critical skills, potentially hindering employability in the competitive AI industry. The impact of not solving this problem includes delayed skill development, a weaker portfolio, and missed opportunities for community engagement and personal brand building within the tech community.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is the development of the Online Card Game, a web-based multiplayer game integrated into ThinkHeads.ai.

*   **Concept:** The core idea is to create an interactive online card game that features AI-driven challenges, such as AI/ML-themed card effects, powered by an LLM (Ollama). The game will support educational gameplay to reinforce AI/ML concepts and provide a platform for real-time multiplayer interaction.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Multiplayer card gameplay (F10)
    *   AI-driven educational challenges (F11)
    *   Game state persistence using PostgreSQL (F12)
    *   Low-latency gameplay (<1s for API responses)
    *   Secure data storage
    *   99% uptime
*   **Scope (In/Out):**
    *   **In:** Development of core multiplayer card gameplay, AI-driven educational challenges, game state persistence, and integration with ThinkHeads.ai. Focus on MVP features (F10, F11, F12).
    *   **Out:** Extensive commercialization features, complex monetization strategies, or support for a massive number of concurrent players beyond initial targets.

## 4. Alignment with Strategic Goals

This project highly aligns with the developer's strategic goals by offering significant learning value in game development, real-time APIs, and LLM integration. It also provides substantial portfolio impact by showcasing a gamified ed-tech application on ThinkHeads.ai, which is appealing to potential employers. The project contributes to ThinkHeads.aiâ€™s engagement by attracting users with interactive AI/ML learning experiences. It aligns with the non-commercial, skill-focused aspects of the business model and the high learning/portfolio value criteria for project selection.

## 6. Technical Overview

*   **Architecture:** The system will involve a web-based frontend, a backend API for game logic and real-time interactions, an LLM for AI-driven challenges, and a database for game state storage. The backend APIs and game server will be hosted on Linode, while the LLM (Ollama) and PostgreSQL database will run on Proxmox. n8n will be used for automation.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   LLM: Ollama
    *   Database: PostgreSQL
    *   API Framework: FastAPI
    *   Automation: n8n
    *   Hosting: Proxmox (for Ollama, PostgreSQL), Linode (for APIs, game server)
    *   CDN/Security: Cloudflare (free tier)
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Existing Proxmox and Linode infrastructure.
    *   Open-source tools (Ollama, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, n8n).
    *   Cloudflare free tier.

## 7. Success Metrics & KPIs

*   **Portfolio Impact:** The project will be featured in the main portfolio by July 2026, aiming for 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn by the same date.
*   **Learning Outcome:** Master 3+ AI/ML and game development skills (game development, real-time APIs, LLM integration, PostgreSQL) by July 2026.
*   **Engagement:** Contribute to 100+ unique visitors to ThinkHeads.ai by July 2026.
*   **Performance:** Ensure <1s API response time and 99% uptime for the game server.
*   **Implementation:** Deploy MVP (F10-F11) by June 2026, with full features (F12) by July 2026.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk Description | Likelihood (Low/Med/High) | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Technical Complexity (Game Logic) | Med | High | Test game mechanics in `dockTest1` before deployment; use community resources for game design. |
| Time Overrun | Med | High | Phase development (F10 by Apr 2026, F11 by Jun 2026); automate with n8n for efficiency. |
| Resource Conflicts (Ollama) | Med | Med | Schedule Ollama tasks in `dockProd1` to avoid conflicts with other sub-products. |
| Low User Adoption | Med | Low | Focus on personal use initially; promote via X/LinkedIn post-MVP to gauge interest. |
| Learning Delay (Not doing project) | High | High | Proceed with development to gain expertise in game development and real-time API skills. |
| Portfolio Weakness (Not doing project) | High | High | Develop the project to add a gamified ed-tech project, increasing employer appeal. |
