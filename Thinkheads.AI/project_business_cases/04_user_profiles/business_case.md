## 1. Executive Summary

The User Profiles V0 project aims to develop an AI-driven user management system for ThinkHeads.ai. This system will enable personalized user profiles, track AI/ML learning progress, and integrate with a portfolio display. As a solo, non-commercial endeavor, its primary focus is to advance AI/ML/DL skills and enhance the author's professional portfolio for improved employability in the AI industry. The project leverages existing infrastructure (Proxmox, Linode, open-source tools) to minimize costs while maximizing learning and visibility. It is prioritized for its foundational role in user engagement and portfolio appeal, targeting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by September 2026. This business case details the project's concept, costs, benefits, risks, and strategic alignment to justify its development.

## 2. Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by this project is the lack of a personalized, AI-driven system for managing user profiles, tracking learning progress, and integrating portfolio elements within the ThinkHeads.ai platform. This absence limits user engagement and the ability to effectively showcase AI/ML/DL skills in a practical application.

*   **What is the core problem?** The current ThinkHeads.ai platform lacks an integrated system for personalized user profiles, AI/ML learning progress tracking, and portfolio integration.
*   **Who is affected by it?** The primary affected party is the solo developer/learner, as it hinders the ability to demonstrate advanced AI/ML/DL skills and create a compelling portfolio piece. Secondary affected parties are potential users of thinkheads.ai who would benefit from personalized experiences and a more engaging platform.
*   **What is the impact of not solving this problem?** Not addressing this problem would delay the acquisition of critical user management and AI-driven personalization skills, weaken the developer's portfolio appeal to potential employers, and limit user engagement on ThinkHeads.ai.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is the User Profiles V0 project, an AI-driven user management system integrated into ThinkHeads.ai.

*   **Concept:** The core idea is to create a system that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) like Ollama with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized learning progress insights and portfolio management. User data will be securely stored in a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   User profile creation (F13)
    *   Learning progress tracking (F14)
    *   Portfolio integration (F15)
*   **Scope (In/Out):**
    *   **In Scope:** User profile creation, learning progress tracking, portfolio integration, low-latency responses (<2s for LLM queries), secure user data, 99% uptime.
    *   **Out of Scope:** Advanced social networking features, real-time collaboration tools, complex payment processing.

## 4. Alignment with Strategic Goals

This project strongly aligns with the broader company vision and strategic objectives by:
*   **Enhancing User Engagement:** Providing personalized profiles and progress tracking directly supports increased user interaction on ThinkHeads.ai.
*   **Foundational for Future Development:** The user authentication and database infrastructure developed will be reusable for other sub-products (e.g., Learning Assistant), contributing to the scalability of ThinkHeads.ai.
*   **Skill Development & Portfolio Enhancement:** As a non-commercial, skill-focused project, it directly contributes to the developer's mastery of critical AI/ML skills and strengthens the professional portfolio, aligning with career advancement goals.
*   **Leveraging Existing Resources:** The project's reliance on existing hardware and open-source software aligns with a cost-effective and efficient development strategy.

## 5. Target Audience & User Personas

The primary target audience for this project is the solo developer/learner ("Self" persona) who will gain significant skill development and portfolio enhancement. Secondary audiences include:

*   **Potential Employers:** The project serves as a tangible demonstration of expertise in user management, AI-driven personalization, and full-stack development, appealing to employers in the AI industry.
*   **Tech Community:** The project aims to enhance user engagement on ThinkHeads.ai, potentially attracting more visitors and fostering community interaction.

## 6. Technical Overview

*   **Architecture:** The system will utilize a microservices-oriented approach. Ollama (LLM) and PostgreSQL (database) will be hosted on Proxmox, while APIs will be served via Linode using FastAPI. n8n will be used for automation.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **LLM:** Ollama
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL
    *   **API Framework:** FastAPI
    *   **Automation:** n8n
    *   **Hosting:** Proxmox (local), Linode (cloud)
    *   **Security:** Cloudflare (free tier for SSL)
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Existing Proxmox and Linode infrastructure.
    *   Open-source tools (Ollama, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, n8n).
    *   Cloudflare for SSL.
