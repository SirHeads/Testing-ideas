# Budget and Financials

## Revenue Model

ThinkHeads.ai currently operates on a zero-revenue model. The primary focus is on development and innovation rather than commercialization.

## Operational Costs

The project is committed to minimizing operational costs by leveraging open-source software and efficient cloud infrastructure.

- **Software:** Reliance on a suite of powerful, free, and open-source tools for development, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Infrastructure:** Utilization of cost-effective cloud services for hosting and computation.

## Projected Budget

The projected monthly budget is expected to remain **under $100**. This covers all necessary infrastructure and service costs required to maintain operations.
