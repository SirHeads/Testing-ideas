# RAG Integration Strategy for Corporate Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategy and best practices for authoring and maintaining corporate strategy documents to ensure they are optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The goal is to create a high-quality, queryable knowledge source for applications like coding assistants and user experience bots.

## 2. Content Authoring Guidelines

To create content that is easily parsable and understandable by RAG models, follow these guidelines:

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write in clear, simple language. Avoid jargon and complex sentence structures.
*   **Active Voice:** Use the active voice to make the content more direct and easier to understand (e.g., "The team will develop a new feature" instead of "A new feature will be developed by the team").
*   **Structured Content:**
    *   **Headings:** Use a clear hierarchy of headings (H1, H2, H3) to structure the document.
    *   **Lists:** Use bulleted or numbered lists to break down information into digestible points.
    *   **Tables:** Use tables to present structured data, such as feature comparisons or project timelines.
*   **Atomic Paragraphs:** Each paragraph should focus on a single, distinct topic. This helps create clean, focused chunks for embedding.
*   **Explicit Connections:** Clearly state relationships between concepts. Instead of assuming the reader knows the connection, spell it out.

## 3. Metadata Strategy

A robust metadata strategy is crucial for filtering, source attribution, and maintaining content quality. We will use YAML front-matter at the beginning of each Markdown file.

### Proposed Front-Matter Fields:

```yaml
---
document_type: 'business_strategy' # e.g., business_strategy, product_strategy, technical_vision
status: 'draft' # e.g., draft, in_review, final, archived
owner: '@username' # GitHub or team username of the document owner
review_cadence: 'quarterly' # e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually
last_reviewed: 'YYYY-MM-DD' # Date of the last review
version: '1.0' # Document version
---
```

### Field Descriptions:

*   `document_type`: Helps in filtering searches to specific domains.
*   `status`: Indicates the current state of the document.
*   `owner`: Assigns responsibility for maintenance.
*   `review_cadence`: Specifies how often the document should be reviewed.
*   `last_reviewed`: Tracks when the document was last verified for accuracy.
*   `version`: Tracks document versions for historical context.

## 4. Chunking Strategy

The goal of chunking is to create small, semantically meaningful pieces of text for embedding. Our authoring guidelines support this, but here are additional recommendations:

*   **Logical Grouping:** Structure documents so that related information is co-located. For example, a section on a specific product feature should contain all relevant details about that feature.
*   **Hard Breaks:** Use horizontal rules (`---`) to signal a definitive break between topics that should not be chunked together.
*   **Document Size:** Aim for documents that are focused on a specific topic. A 50-page document covering the entire business is less effective than ten 5-page documents covering specific aspects of the business.

## 5. Maintenance and Review Cadence

To ensure the knowledge base remains current and accurate, a clear maintenance and review schedule is essential.

### Proposed Review Cadence:

| Document Type             | Review Cadence | Owner Role          |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Vision & Mission          | Annually       | C-Suite             |
| V2MOM                     | Quarterly      | C-Suite / Dept. Heads |
| Product Roadmap           | Quarterly      | Head of Product     |
| Technical Vision          | Annually       | CTO                 |
| Architectural Principles  | Bi-Annually    | Architecture Team   |
| KPIs and Metrics          | Quarterly      | Operations          |

### Review Process:

1.  **Notification:** The document `owner` is automatically notified when a review is due.
2.  **Review:** The `owner` reviews the document for accuracy, relevance, and clarity.
3.  **Update:** The `owner` makes necessary updates and increments the `version` and `last_reviewed` date in the front-matter.
4.  **Approval:** For major changes, a pull request should be created for peer review.

By implementing this strategy, we can ensure that our corporate strategy documents become a reliable and valuable asset for our RAG applications.
